#Task
#The provided code stub reads two integers from STDIN,  and . Add code to print three lines where:

1.The first line contains the sum of the two numbers.
2.The second line contains the difference of the two numbers (first - second).
3.The third line contains the product of the two numbers.

#Task
#The provided code stub reads two integers,  and , from STDIN.
#Add logic to print two lines. The first line should contain the result of integer division,  // . The second line should contain the result of float division,  / .
#No rounding or formatting is necessary.
